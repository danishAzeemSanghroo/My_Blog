# My_Blog
I have developed this site with HTML, Servlets, JSP, and MySQL Workbench. I have used this on eclipse using Tomcat, and the project is a Maven project.    
Here is the description: 
A web application allows the creation and management of personal blogs. The application supports
registration and login via a public page with an appropriate form. The registration checks the
syntactic validity of the email address and the equality between the fields "password" and "repeat 
password." Registration checks the uniqueness of the username. Each blog post is stored in the
database with the following attributes: a title, a text, a publication date, the author, and any
associated tags. When the user accesses the HOME PAGE, it presents the list of posts he or she
has created, and the list of posts created by other users, sorted by publication date. When the user
When a user clicks on a post that appears in the lists on the HOME PAGE, the POST PAGE appears, which
contains details about the post and a form for commenting on the post. The POST PAGE page
contains a link to return to the HOME PAGE. The application allows the user to log out of
the user.
